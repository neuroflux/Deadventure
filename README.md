Deadventure - Incremental/Semi-Idle casual game thing

Deadventure - Notes for version 0.7 Alpha:

--- NEW UPDATES ---

  * BUGTRACKER and bug tracker link on game.
  * Reversed: Thirst/Hunger bars and Proximity icons.
  * Added maximum proximity above proximity icons.
  * Loot is now tied to an area type - I.e. Crowbars are building sites and factories and police baton at police areas etc.
  * New "found items" area stays on the right of the screen.
  * Clicking an item no longer makes all items of that type disapear.
  * Removed duplicate "travelled" text.
  * Slow searches now yield more items and a greater chance of finding some.
  * Better object detection when using an item (plus more descriptive actions).
  * Removed empty water bottle and added half full bottle until water sources are implemented.
  * Some minor CSS changes.
  
--- PREVIOUS UPDATES ---

  * Some small CSS layout amends.
  * Pausing actually pauses the hunger and thirst now! No more dying when paused.
  * Added difficulty options, difficulty = zombie proximity levels.
  * Added unsorted (and very basic) hi-score table!
  * On "slow" searching, you get 1 more item.
  * Items you find and items in your inventory now have stats when you hover over them.
  * Stealth button added! Level up stealth by travelling while enabled.
  * When you die, your save is auto-deleted. Your score is added to the hi-score table though.
  * The higher your stealth level the less likely the zombie proximity will go down.
  * Containers (such as backpacks) are now in and working, they all weight 0.1 but provide extra weight carrying. Currently you cannot take one off, only replace with a new one and the previous one is destroyed.
  * Added a GitHub repo for all to see my messy code.
  * Made the donate bar hideable. I don't want to force you to donate.
  * Pause function added for those times you get hungry in real life too.
  * Areas now show percentage chance of getting loot there.
  * Added keyboard shortcuts:   
       s = slow search
	   f = fast search
	   i = inventory
	   r - rest
	   t - travel
	   p - pause
	   enter - save
  * Craftables started to be added (nailed baseball bat and hairspray bomb).
  * Power of zombies now depends on your strength level. Stronger you are, harder they are.
  * You now start with a proximity of 10 to give you time to get started
  * Random Male and Female names.
  * 168 face pictures found online (temporary until I get artwork done).
  * You now start with 50% hunger and 50% thirst.
  ...But...
  * You start with an Apple.
  * [BUG] Interface gets a little messy when you get down to 1024x768 - I recommend 1280x720 at the moment :/
  * [BUG] Equipped weapon not shown on screen  
  * Totally new design and new name.
  * Random Google Images (low quality and a little too random, but it'll do for now).
  * Area spawning now has a rarity - house are more common than military. Loot is still random, I will be adding loot rarity next.
  * You can now pick up too many items and be encumbered, drop or use some to be able to travel again.
  * Zombies now continue to hunt you when you are looting and resting! Beware!
  * New score system incorporating all experience and skills.
  * Experience system, the more you do the more that skill gains. Once they hit 100 - you level up in that skill and things become easier and faster.
  * Basic fighting system in place defending means you take less damage, gain Exp but don't attack. You can also run away like a pussy.
  * Weapons now affect how much damage you do per hit, equip them by clicking them in your inventory.
  * The faster the zombie, the more mean it is.
  * Travelling now makes you more hungry/thirsty.
  * Small chance of finding a book to increase your experience bars. One book per skill.
  * Standing still (not touching any buttons) now makes zombies come towards you
  * New subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/deadventure
  * 50 first names, 50 surnames - 2500 combinations.
  * A few new items, nothing massive until I do the item overhaul that I'm planning. This will incorporate crafting.
  * [BUG] Occassionally buttons get stuck for some reason, please email me if you find this (include what you did) bugs@barriereader.co.uk.
